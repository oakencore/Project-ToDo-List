## To-Do List Application

This is a to-do list application that I created as part of my learning journey. In this project, I mainly learnt about:

- **Local Storage**: Storing, showing, removing and editing data stored in the browser.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically manipulating the DOM to display to-do items, update their details, and remove them.
- **Constructors**: Using a constructor to create multiple objects.

The application has the following features:
- Add, edit, and delete to-do items
- Mark to-do items as complete
- Filter to-do items by project or due-date (week, or today).
